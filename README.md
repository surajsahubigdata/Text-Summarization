ðŸ¦œ LangChain: Summarize Text From YT or Website
This Streamlit application leverages LangChain and Groq's LLM API to summarize content from YouTube videos or websites. The app allows users to input a YouTube video URL or a generic website URL and get a concise 300-word summary of the content.

ðŸ›  Features
Summarizes content from YouTube videos or web pages.
Uses Groq's Gemma-7b-It language model API for generating summaries.
Validates the input URL before processing.
Streamlit-based UI for ease of use.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
LangChain: Framework for building applications with LLMs.
Groq LLM: Chat-based LLM for generating summaries.
Streamlit: Web app framework for the user interface.
Python Validators: For URL validation.
YoutubeLoader & UnstructuredURLLoader: For loading content from YouTube videos or websites.

ðŸ“‘ How It Works
The user provides a Groq API key and enters a valid YouTube or website URL.
The URL is validated, and the corresponding content is fetched using either YoutubeLoader or UnstructuredURLLoader.
The content is then summarized using a pre-defined prompt template via LangChain's summarization chain.
The result is displayed in the app.
